# Notebooks Directory

Put your Jupyter notebooks here. However, if you are going to be working with other people
first create a subdirectory for your notebooks, named after your Github account name. 

*This is very important:* You should never check in changes to other people's notebooks, 
since the git merge process will corrupt the notebook. If you need to execute other people's
notebooks, you should either compy them to your own directory first, or besure to undo ( git revert)
and change that you might make, and just exeuting the notebook and waiting for an auto save will 
intruduce changes.
